# Switched_Hue

These scripts will monitor a 'Switched' lamp (one who's power will be turned on and off by a physical switch) connected to a Philips Hue bulb and will then respond by turning on a 'Controlled' Philips Hue lamp (that mirriros the state of the Switched lamp) and also a 'Signal' lamp that is turned on when the Switched lamp is turned on, but is not otherwise turned off.  

The motivation for this script (two versions: one for a Windows terminal and one for a Raspberry Pi Nano) was to monitor a bedside lamp of an elderly relative and allow me to see when she has woken up in the morning, by turning on a lamp in the living room.
